He comes out of silence and opens the door
Waiting for someone to die
Deep in her heart she is hoping for
The long-lost one
How could she know when the promise was made?
So how can it end in this way?

Then four gray walls come tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last

The friends there that she can count upon
Take orders, but always the spirit holds
Scenes of the never-ending trend
She waits for the hours and hours to pass
She looks to the hourglass

Then four gray walls come tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
Those four gray walls were meant to last

As the shadows come down
She sees him leaving
She can recall
Seems that this fire has lost its form
The form of the hourglass

The four gray walls came tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
Those four gray walls were meant to last

Those four gray walls
Four gray walls
