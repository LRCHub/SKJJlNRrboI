What is life like,
From the outside looking in,
What is love for,
When you're under,
And you're sinking in your skin,
What are questions without answers or truth,
What's it all for,
When it's all been done before
Live each day as if it were your last

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

What is God for,
Does he see me,
What are memories,
If you can't keep,
If you can't keep hold of them,
What are feelings,
When there's nothing,
To determine what they mean,
What's it all for when it's all been done before
Live each day as if it were your last
Live each day as it it were your last

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

Start counting minutes and days,
You know they're slipping away,
Becoming hours and years
(As if it were your last)

Don't throw it all away
